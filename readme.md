# simple-watt-calc

I could never find a watt/kg calculator that would do racing categories for me, I could only find something to work out my watt/kg. Therefore I built this simple calculator to do it for me.

This calculator requires you to know your 5s / 1min / 5min power and your current FTP as well as your weight in kilograms. Best place to get these would be from your power curve, the tool uses [Andy Coggan's](http://www.peakscoachinggroup.com/DrAndrewCoggan) power zones.

The tool will also work out which Zwift Racing category you are too.
